		<h6>2006</h6>
        
        <p>When I was in kindergarten I was extremely shy. I didn't like to iniate conversations and would stand by the teachers side all recess.<br> That all changed one recess when i went to grad magnetic building blocks. As i reached in to grab one of the blocks Caiden Corbett turned and bit my cheek.<br> ever since then me Caiden have been best friends. </p>
        
		<h2 id = "allstar">Winning My Allstar Game</h2>
		<h6>2014</h6>
        
        <p>In 7th grade it was my senior year of ABC League football. Every year the league allows teams to pick two seniors to send them to an all star game.<br> After my or last regular season game my coach came to me and told me that I would be the only all star from our team that year. At first I was disappointed that I was the only East Brady kid, but after the first few practices I made some amazing friends.<br> Come game day we ended up destroying the other team 45-0.</p>
        
		<h2 id = "rivalry">Beating Moniteau</h2>
		<h6>2019</h6>
        
        <p>My senior year of highschool, my last year to play football with my friends. After losing to Moniteau last year we weren't going to let them best us again<br> Before the game some kids were trash talking our team, even though they had a horrible record< and that was the final straw. At  first the game started slow, but coming out second we came to play.<br> It will be one of my best memories with my friends.</p>
